## [0.14.2] - 2025-04-04 12:00:00

### Added

- `utils.pct_change_unstationarized` replaced with `utils.unstationarize_vars`, which allows for more general use of a utility to find unstationarized values of time series output
- `output_plots.py` and `output_tables.py` are updated to all for plots and tables of unstationarized output for variables of any type, not just percentage changes.
- `ouput_tables.tp_output_dump_table` has been renamed `output_tables.time_series_table`
- `utils.param_dump_json` has been renamed `utils.params_to_json`
- API docs have been updated to include functions left out previously and for new function names

## [0.14.1] - 2025-03-16 12:00:00

### Bug Fix

- Packages `model_variables.json` with `ogcore`

## [0.14.0] - 2025-03-16 07:00:00

### Added

- Updates the output dictionaries for `TPI.py` and `SS.py` to use consistent variables names
- Adds a `model_variables.json` file that has metadata about the model variables and is used to build a new chapter in the documentation describing the model variables
- Replaces `print` commands in `TPI.py` and `SS.py` with `logger.info` commands for easier suppression of output

## [0.13.2] - 2024-12-08 12:00:00

### Added

- Adds KOR, THA, BRA to the list of countries in the `demographics.py` module.

## [0.13.1] - 2024-10-02 12:00:00

### Added

- Three new parameters to adjust government spending amounts in the case of `baseline_spending=True`:
  - `alpha_bs_G`: the proportional adjustment to the level of baseline spending on government consumption (time varying, default value is 1.0 for each model period)
  - `alpha_bs_T`: the proportional adjustment to the level of baseline spending on non-pension transfers (time varying, default value is 1.0 for each model period)
  - `alpha_bs_I`: the proportional adjustment to the level of baseline spending on infrastructure investment (time varying, default value is 1.0 for each model period)

## [0.13.0] - 2024-09-26 12:00:00

### Added

- Updates all of the documentation.
    - Adds remittances to all instances of the household budget constraint
    - Rewrites bequests and transfers components of household budget constraint in terms of individual variables in all instances
    - Adds a household transfers section to `households.md` with subsections on bequests, remittances, government transfers, and universal basic income
    - Changes all instances of $p_t Y_t$ to $Y_t
    - Updates the steady-state equilibrium algorithm description in `equilibrium.md`
    - Added updates to the government pensions descriptions in `government.md` and added `pensions` to all instances of the household budget constraint.
    - Updates the docstrings in `tax.py` for the wealth tax ETR and MTR functions. The code is right. I just thought there was a clearer specification of the equations in LaTeX.
- Adds remittances to the OG-Core code
    - Adds aggregate remittances function `get_RM()` to `aggregates.py`
    - Adds household remittances function `get_rm()` to `household.py`
    - Adds four new remittance parameters: `alpha_RM_1`, `g_RM`, `alpha_RM_T`, `eta_RM`
    - We model aggregate remittances as a percent of GDP in the first period, then growing at a specified rate that can deviate from the country growth rate until the cutoff rule period, after which the remittance growth rate trends back to the long-run model growth rate (growth rate in population and productivity). We also model remittances in reforms as being a percentage of baseline GDP. In this way, if remittance parameters are not changed in the reform, remittances remain at their baseline levels. The only way they change is if their parameter values are changed.
    - Adds 3 tests using the `test_get_RM()` function in `test_aggregates.py`
    - Adds 4 tests using the `test_get_rm()` function in `test_household.py`
    - Changes the `initial_guess_r_SS` in two tests in `test_SS.py` because they were not solving with their current values
- Increases `RC_SS` steady-state resource constraint tolerance from 1e-9 to 1e-8 because two `test_run_SS()` tests were failing in `test_SS.py` with resource constraints errors just bigger than 1e-9 (-2.29575914e-09 for [Baseline, small open] and -2.29575914e-09 for [Reform, small open]).
- Increases `RC_TPI` transition path resource constraint tolerance from 1e-5 to 1e-4 in because one `test_run_TPI_full_run()` test was failing in `test_TPI.py` with a resource constraint error just bigger than 1e-5 (1.4459913381864586e-05 for `[Baseline, M=3 non-zero Kg]`).
- Updated two directory path references that were out of date in `test_run_example.py`.
- Updated expected value tuples and dictionaries in `test_txfunc.py`.

## Previous versions

### Summary

- Version [0.7.0] on August 30, 2021 was the first time that the OG-USA repository was detached from all of the core model logic, which was named OG-Core. Before this version, OG-USA was part of what is now the [`OG-Core`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core) repository. In the next version of OG-USA, we adjusted the version numbering to begin with 0.1.0. This initial version of 0.7.0, was sequential from what OG-USA used to be when the OG-Core project was called OG-USA.
- Any earlier versions of OG-USA can be found in the [`OG-Core`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core) repository [release history](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core/releases) from [v.0.6.4](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core/releases/tag/v0.6.4) (Jul. 20, 2021) or earlier.
