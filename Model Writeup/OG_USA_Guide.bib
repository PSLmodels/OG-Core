  abstract={This paper explores the economic implications of an allowance for corporate equity (ACE), a comprehensive business income tax (CBIT) and a combination of the two in the EU. We illustrate the key trade-offs in designing ACE and CBIT in the presence of tax distortions at various decision margins of firms, such as its financial structure, investment, profit allocation and discrete location. Using an applied general equilibrium model for Europe, we quantitatively assess the effects of ACE, CBIT and combined reforms in EU countries. The results suggest that ACE is welfare improving as long as corporate tax rates are not used to cover the cost of base narrowing. CBIT typically reduces welfare by exacerbating marginal investment distortions. When governments adjust statutory corporate tax rates to balance their budget, however, CBIT reforms become more attractive while ACE reforms are welfare reducing in a number of countries. European coordination of reforms mitigates fiscal spillovers within the EU and renders ACE reforms more, and CBIT reforms less, attractive for welfare. A combination of ACE and CBIT reforms can be designed to be revenue neutral and welfare improving through smaller financial distortions.},

Harberger's celebrated model of the corporate income tax is how to treat noncorporate production in primarily corporate sectors and corporate production in primarily noncorporate sectors. This paper presents a two-good model with corporate and noncorporate production of both goods. The incidence of corporate tax in the authors' mutual production model can differ markedly from that in the Harberger model. The difference between the two models in deadweight loss is also striking, with losses in the mutual production model many times larger than those in the Harberger model.

  firms. We develop a model in which firms post job offers characterized
  by an hours requirement and workers pay search costs to find jobs.
  We present evidence supporting three predictions of this model by
  analyzing bunching at kinks using Danish tax records. First, larger
  kinks generate larger taxable income elasticities. Second, kinks
  that apply to a larger group of workers generate larger elasticities.
  Third, the distribution of job offers is tailored to match workers'
  aggregate tax preferences in equilibrium. Our results suggest that
  macro elasticities may be substantially larger than the estimates

@techreport{KGKC2013,
	Abstract = {This paper studies the quantitative implications of wealth taxation
  (as opposed to capital income taxation) in an incomplete markets
  model with return rate heterogeneity across individuals. The key
  source of heterogeneity comes from the fact that some individuals
  have better entrepreneurial skills than others, allowing them to
  obtain a higher return on their wealth. In this environment, consider
  a flat-rate wealth tax. This will shift the after-tax return distribution
  downward, which has two effects. First, entrepreneurs at the left
  tail of the productivity distribution now have an even more negative
  return, causing their wealth to shrink (faster) over time, in turn
  increasing the share of aggregate wealth owned and operated by the
  more skilled entrepreneurs. This reallocation increases aggregate
  productivity. Second, and at the same time, because such a wealth
  tax is regressive, it increases wealth (and welfare) inequality in
  the population. To provide a quantitative assessment of these different
  effects and the optimal level of wealth taxation, we build and simulate
  an overlapping generations model with individual-specific returns
  on capital and idiosyncratic shocks to labor income. Entrepreneurial
  ability (or rate of return) is allowed to vary both within a generation
  and across generations (from father to son). In this environment,
  the children of very successful entrepreneurs will inherit large
  amounts of wealth but may not be able to work that capital as efficiently.
  By taxing all wealth at the same rate, the society can weed out these
  low-productivity children from those with better uses of capital.
  Clearly, if capital markets were efficient, wealth would be put at
  its most productive use without taxes, simply by high productivity
  individuals renting capital from those with low returns. In this
  sense, incomplete markets is essential to the analysis in this paper.
  The key exercise we conduct is to consider an economy calibrated
  to the US data and implement a },

	Abstract = {We consider a general framework to study the evolution of wage and
  earnings residuals that incorporates features highlighted by two
  influential but distinct literatures in economics: (i) unobserved
  skills with changing non-linear pricing functions and (ii) idiosyncratic
  shocks with both permanent and transitory components. We first provide
  nonparametric identification conditions for the distribution of unobserved
  skills, all unobserved skill pricing functions, and (nearly) all
  distributions for both permanent and MA(q) transitory shocks. We
  then discuss identification and estimation using a moment-based approach,
  restricting unobserved skill pricing functions to be polynomials.
  Using data on log earnings for men ages 30-59 in the PSID, we estimate
  the evolution of unobserved skill pricing functions and the distributions
  of unobserved skills, transitory, and permanent shocks from 1970
  to 2008. We highlight five main findings: (i) The returns to unobserved
  skill rose over the 1970s and early 1980s, fell over the late 1980s
  and early 1990s, and then remained quite stable through the end of
  our sample period. Since the mid-1990s, we observe some evidence
  of polarization: the returns to unobserved skill declined at the
  bottom of the distribution while they remained relatively constant
  over the top half. (ii) The variance of unobserved skill changed
  very little across most cohorts in our sample (those born between
  1925 and 1955). (iii) The variance of transitory shocks jumped up
  considerably in the early 1980s but shows little long-run trend otherwise
  over the more than thirty year period we study. (iv) The variance
  of permanent shocks declined very slightly over the 1970s, then rose
  systematically through the end of our sample by 15 to 20 log points.
  The increase in this variance over the 1980s and 1990s was strongest
  for workers with low unobserved ability. (v) In most years, the distribution
  of unobserved skill pricing is positively skewed, while the distributions

  abstract={We examine the use of dynamic overlapping generations (OLG) computable general equilibrium (CGE) models to analyze the economic effects of tax reforms, using as a paradigm our Diamond–Zodrow (DZ) model. Such models are especially well-suited to analyzing both the short-run transitional and the long-run dynamic macroeconomic effects of tax reforms, including the time paths of reform-induced changes in labor supply, saving, and investment, as well as the redistributional effects of reforms across and within generations. We begin with a brief overview of the use of OLG-CGE models in the analysis of tax reform, focusing on the seminal contribution of Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987). We then consider a variety of extensions of this work, including the multiple-good, multiple-individual model constructed by Fullerton and Rogers (1993), as well as the addition of open economy factors, human capital accumulation and uncertainty. Many of the applications of these models have focused on changes in capital income taxation or, more generally, the replacement of an income tax system that fully taxes capital income with a consumption-based tax system that exempts normal returns to capital, and we focus on such reforms. We describe in considerable detail the DZ model, which is characterized by 55 cohorts, 12 income groups within each cohort, four production sectors and explicit calculation of reform-induced changes in asset values. We conclude by describing numerous applications of the DZ model, ranging from incremental reforms of the income tax system including deficit-financed tax cuts to ‘fundamental tax reforms’ that involve replacing the income tax with a consumption-based tax system, to the implementation of a value-added tax imposed in addition to the income tax as a means of reducing current deficits and the national debt in the US.},
