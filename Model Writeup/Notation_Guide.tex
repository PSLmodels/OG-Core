\begin{document}

This document and the associated file Notation\_Guide.xlsx will serve as the official guide to notation used throughout the model.  The goal is to make sure variables and parameters have intuitive and consistent notation.

The notation will be grouped into three tables: endogenous variables, exogenous variables, and parameters.  Note that other versions of the variables used here will exist.  Throughout, we will try to adhear to the following rules:

\begin{enumerate}\item Use ``tilde" (e.g., $\tilde{c}$) to denote stationarized versions of variables\item Use ``hats" (e.g., $\hat{c}$) to denote percent deviations from steady state (or percent changes?) for a variable
\item Use ``bars" over variables (e.g., $\bar{c}$) to denote variables in per unit of output (e.g., $\bar{c}=\frac{C}{Y}$)\item Use capital letters for aggregate values, lower case for per capita values (e.g., $c_{t}=$ per capital consumption in period $t$, $C_{t}=$ aggregate consumption in period $t$).
\item The English alphabet is used for variables
\item The Greek alphabet is used for parameters
\item When possible, keep variables to one letter (\textcolor{red}{Should we worry about this? Or should we make readability key?})
\end{enumerate}

\textcolor{red}{Note that we might think about what assigned letters we can use in our Python code and it there are conflicts with that.  Because it would be nice for users of the code to be able to use the same notation as in the text.}

\section{Fixing Inconsistencies in the Notation}

    $\upsilon$  & Replace v as labor supply elasticity  \\
    $\bar{q}$ & Average Q?? Does break rule for bar used for per capital variables… \\

    $\eta$ & Use this instead of $\lambda$ for lifetime income distribution (saving $\lambda$ for Lagrangian multipliers) \\
    $Z$   & Aggregate bequests??  Doesn't fit right, but would avoid two letters… \\
    $\kappa$ & Shift parameter in disutility of labor \\
    $\psi_{1}-\psi_{4}$ & Parameters of the income tax function \\
    $\nu$ & Use instead of $\beta$ as scaling parameter in investment adjustment cost function \\

Also, we should use lower case letter for firm investment, capital stock, output. However, the lower case $i$ for firm investment conflicts with the $i$ for the immigration rate.  We might also want to to use $i$ for the nominal interest rate at some point (e.g. using both $r$ and $i$ to differentiate between the before and after tax rates).

\subsection{Handling notation for consumption}

The model has individuals consuming multiple goods, $c_{i,j,s,t}$.  Summing over $i$ for the individual's consumption we get $c_{j,s,t}$, consumption of the composite consumption good.  The total consumption of this composite consumption good needs to be broken down into the component that is due to the minimum consumption requirements and that is ``supernumerary" consumption.  Right now, I've written these as $\bar{c}_{j,s}$ and $\tilde{c}_{j,s,t}$, respectively.  However, this notation breaks the rules about the use of tildes and bars on variables that we might like to follow.  Also, note that minimum consumption requirements are technically parameters, so maybe should be using a Greek letter rather than $\bar{c}_{j,s}$ for these.

Any ideas to fix this?  One idea is to use Gothic c, $\mathfrak{c}$, for discretionary consumption.  Can't think of a good Greek letter leftover for minimum consumption, though...
