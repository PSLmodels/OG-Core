    "  We start the `OG-Core` section on modeling with a description of the household demographics of the model. {cite}`Nishiyama:2015` and {cite}`DeBackerEtAl:2019` have recently shown that demographic dynamics are likely the biggest influence on macroeconomic time series, exhibiting more influence than fiscal variables or household preference parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this chapter, we characterize the equations and parameters that govern the transition dynamics of the population distribution by age. In `OG-Core`, we take the approach of taking mortality rates and fertility rates from outside estimates. But we estimate our immigration rates as residuals using the mortality rates, fertility rates, and at least two consecutive periods of population distribution data. This approach makes sense if one modeling a country in which in one is not confident in the immigration rate data. If the country has good immigration data, then the immigration residual approach we describe below can be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "  We define $\\omega_{s,t}$ as the number of households of age $s$ alive at time $t$. A measure $\\omega_{1,t}$ of households is born in each period $t$ and live for up to $E+S$ periods, with $S\\geq 4$.[^calibage_note] Households are termed ``youth'', and do not participate in market activity during ages $1\\leq s\\leq E$. The households enter the workforce and economy in period $E+1$ and remain in the workforce until they unexpectedly die or live until age $s=E+S$. We model the population with households age $s\\leq E$ outside of the workforce and economy in order most closely match the empirical population dynamics.\n",

    "  This model requires information about mortality rates $\\rho_s$ in order to solve for the household's problem each period.
