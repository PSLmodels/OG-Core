    "In this section, we describe what is arguably the most important economic agent in the `OG-Core` model: the household. We model households in `OG-Core` rather than individuals, because we want to abstract from the concepts of gender, marital status, and number of children. Furthermore, the household is the usual unit of account in tax data. Because `OG-Core` is primarily a fiscal policy model, it is advantageous to have the most granular unit of account be the household.\n",

A measure $\\omega_{1,t}$ of households is born each period, become economically relevant at age $s=E+1$ if they survive to that age, and live for up to $E+S$ periods ($S$ economically active periods), with the population of age-$s$ individuals in period $t$ being $\\omega_{s,t}$. Let the age of a household be indexed by $s = \\{1,2,...E+S\\}$.\n",

    "  At birth, each household age $s=1$ is randomly assigned one of $J$ ability groups, indexed by $j$. Let $\\lambda_j$ represent the fraction of individuals in each ability group, such that $\\sum_j\\lambda_j=1$. Note that this implies that the distribution across ability types in each age is given by $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}=[\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,...\\lambda_J]$. Once an household is born and assigned to an ability type, it remains that ability type for its entire lifetime. This is deterministic ability heterogeneity as described in the calibration chapter on the lifetime earnings process in the country-specific repository documentation. Let $e_{j,s}>0$ be a matrix of ability-levels such that an individual of ability type $j$ will have lifetime abilities of $[e_{j,1},e_{j,2},...e_{j,E+S}]$.\n",
