	between adjustment costs for workers and hours constraints set by
	firms. We develop a model in which firms post job offers characterized
	by an hours requirement and workers pay search costs to find jobs.
	We present evidence supporting three predictions of this model by
	analyzing bunching at kinks using Danish tax records. First, larger
	kinks generate larger taxable income elasticities. Second, kinks
	that apply to a larger group of workers generate larger elasticities.
	Third, the distribution of job offers is tailored to match workers'
	aggregate tax preferences in equilibrium. Our results suggest that
	macro elasticities may be substantially larger than the estimates
	obtained using standard microeconometric methods. Copyright 2011,

@techreport{KGKC2013,
	Abstract = {This paper studies the quantitative implications of wealth taxation
	(as opposed to capital income taxation) in an incomplete markets
	model with return rate heterogeneity across individuals. The key
	source of heterogeneity comes from the fact that some individuals
	have better entrepreneurial skills than others, allowing them to
	obtain a higher return on their wealth. In this environment, consider
	a flat-rate wealth tax. This will shift the after-tax return distribution
	downward, which has two effects. First, entrepreneurs at the left
	tail of the productivity distribution now have an even more negative
	return, causing their wealth to shrink (faster) over time, in turn
	increasing the share of aggregate wealth owned and operated by the
	more skilled entrepreneurs. This reallocation increases aggregate
	productivity. Second, and at the same time, because such a wealth
	tax is regressive, it increases wealth (and welfare) inequality in
	the population. To provide a quantitative assessment of these different
	effects and the optimal level of wealth taxation, we build and simulate
	an overlapping generations model with individual-specific returns
	on capital and idiosyncratic shocks to labor income. Entrepreneurial
	ability (or rate of return) is allowed to vary both within a generation
	and across generations (from father to son). In this environment,
	the children of very successful entrepreneurs will inherit large
	amounts of wealth but may not be able to work that capital as efficiently.
	By taxing all wealth at the same rate, the society can weed out these
	low-productivity children from those with better uses of capital.
	Clearly, if capital markets were efficient, wealth would be put at
	its most productive use without taxes, simply by high productivity
	individuals renting capital from those with low returns. In this
	sense, incomplete markets is essential to the analysis in this paper.
	The key exercise we conduct is to consider an economy calibrated
	to the US data and implement a },

	Abstract = { This article attempts to document and account for the long-run evolution of inheritance. We find that in a country like France the annual flow of inheritance was about 20--25\% of national income between 1820 and 1910, down to less than 5\% in 1950, and back up to about 15\% by 2010. A simple theoretical model of wealth accumulation, growth, and inheritance can fully account for the observed U-shaped pattern and levels. Using this model, we find that under plausible assumptions the annual bequest flow might reach about 20--25\% of national income by 2050. This corresponds to a capitalized bequest share in total wealth accumulation well above 100\%. Our findings illustrate the fact that when the growth rate g is small, and when the rate of return to private wealth r is permanently and substantially larger than the growth rate (say, r \&equals; 4--5\% versus g \&equals; 1--2\%), which was the case in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century and is likely to happen again in the twenty-first century, then past wealth and inheritance are bound to play a key role for aggregate wealth accumulation and the structure of lifetime inequality. Contrary to a widespread view, modern economic growth did not kill inheritance. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.},

@article{PS2003,
	Abstract = { This paper presents new homogeneous series on top shares of income and wages from 1913 to 1998 in the United States using individual tax returns data. Top income and wages shares display a U-shaped pattern over the century. Our series suggest that the large shocks that capital owners experienced during the Great Depression and World War II have had a permanent effect on top capital incomes. We argue that steep progressive income and estate taxation may have prevented large fortunes from fully recovering from these shocks. Top wage shares were flat before World War II, dropped precipitously during the war, and did not start to recover before the late 1960s but are now higher than before World War II. As a result, the working rich have replaced the rentiers at the top of the income distribution. � 2001 the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology},
