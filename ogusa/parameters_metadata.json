This means that the Frisch elasticity captures the substitution effects, but not the income effects, of a change in the net of tax wage rate.  A Frisch elasticity of 0.4 would indicate that if the net of tax wage rate increases by 10% then hours worked would increase by 4%, if wealth were held constant.  Note that OG-USA uses an elliptical utility function for labor supply.  We parameterize this function to fit a constant Frisch elasticity function with a Frisch elasticity as input here.",
