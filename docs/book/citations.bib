  abstract={This article proposes a method for integrating individual effective tax rates and marginal tax rates computed from a microsimulation (partial equilibrium) model of tax policy with a dynamic general equilibrium model of tax policy that can provide macroeconomic analysis or dynamic scores of tax reforms. Our approach captures the rich heterogeneity, realistic demographics, and tax-code detail of the microsimulation model and allows this detail to inform a general equilibrium model with a relatively high degree of heterogeneity. In addition, we propose a functional form in which tax rates depend jointly on the levels of both capital income and labor income.},

  abstract={Recently, there has been considerable dis- cussion of a significant increase in the top marginal income tax rate. A salient top marginal tax rate is 70%. This note simulates the effects of a 70% top rate on different groups of filers and shows the im- pacts on revenue and macroeconomic aggregates. We find that an increase in the top marginal tax rate to 70% raises between $5 billion and $250 billion per year over the first 10 years, depending on the size of the top bracket to which this rate is applied. However, our macroeconomic simulations show that a 70% top rate lowers GDP by between 1.7% and 0.1% in the near term, although there may be posi- tive effects on GDP in the longer term.},

  abstract={This Quantitative Note uses the OG-USA open source dynamic general equilibrium overlap- ping generations model to perform a dynamic analy- sis of the Brown-Khanna Grow American Incomes Now (GAIN) Act, which proposes to increase the generosity and scope of the earned income tax credit (EITC) in the United States. I show a simulation of the macroeconomic effects as well as distributional analysis resulting from the GAIN Act. I also sim- ulate the effects of a revenue neutral GAIN Act in which an increase in the marginal income tax rates in the top two personal income brackets exactly off- sets the reduction in total federal tax revenue from the EITC expansion. In the case of the GAIN Act alone, the economy experiences short-run gains, but the increased government debt quickly crowds out in- vestment and causes the economy to start shrinking significantly. In the revenue neutral case, the cost is primarily in terms of large labor supply frictions and a reallocation of the household labor-leisure and consumption-savings decisions.},

We simulate this reform under the assumptions of a closed economy and small open economy. In both cases, the TCJA reform causes significant growth in GDP and employment between 1% and 2% per year in the first 8 years. However, the increasing debt-to-GDP ratio quickly crowds out investment and causes a drag on the economy. Wage growth can range from nearly nonexistent to a mod- est 0.6%, depending critically on the assumption of how much capital will flow into the country.},

I simulate this rate cut under the assump- tions of a closed economy and small open economy, respectively. In both cases, the corporate rate cut causes government revenues to decrease and the debt-to-GDP ratio to increase. In the small open economy scenario, GDP and wages increase by around 3.0%, and 2.5%, respectively. However, in the closed economy setting in which the increased debt service must be satisfied by domestic savings (crowding out), the GDP and wage gains are much smaller and short lived.},
