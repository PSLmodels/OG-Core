# Contributor Guide

The purpose of this guide is to provide the necessary background such that you can make improvements to the `OG-Core` and share them with others working on the model.

`OG-Core` code is tracked by using [`Git`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git) version control software along with the [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) web platform for `Git` workflow and collaboration. Following the next steps will get you up and running and contributing to the model even if you've never used `Git` or other version control software.

If you have already completed the {ref}`Sec_SetupPython` and {ref}`Sec_SetupGit` sections, you can skip to the {ref}`Sec_Workflow` section.


(Sec_SetupPython)=
## Setup Python

`OG-Core` is written in the Python programming language. Download and install the free and most recent Anaconda distribution of Python and associated libraries from [Anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).[^recent_python] You should do this even if you already have Python installed on your computer because the Anaconda distribution contains additional Python packages that are used by `OG-Core` (many of which are not included in other Python installations). You can install the Anaconda distribution without having administrative privileges on your computer and the Anaconda distribution will not interfere with any Python installation that came as part of your computer's operating system.


(Sec_SetupGit)=
## Setup Git

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) user account.

2. Install Git on your local machine by following steps 1-4 on [Git setup](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

3. Tell Git to remember your GitHub password by following steps 1-4 on [password setup](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/).

4. Sign in to GitHub and create your own [remote](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#remote) [repository](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository) (repo) of `OG-Core` by clicking [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#fork) in the upper right corner of the [OG-Core GitHub page](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core). Select your username when asked "Where should we fork this repository?"

5. From your command line on your local computer, navigate to the directory on your computer where you would like your local repo to reside.

6. Create a local repo by entering at the command line the text after the $.[^commandline_note] This step creates a directory called `OG-Core` in the directory that you specified in the prior step:

    ```console
      git clone https://github.com/[github-username]/OG-Core.git
    ```

7. From your command line or terminal, navigate to your local `OG-Core` directory.

8. Make it easier to [push](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull) your local work to others and [pull](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull) others' work to your local machine by entering at the command line:

    ```console
      $ cd OG-Core
      OG-Core$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core.git
    ```

9. Create a conda environment with all of the necessary packages to
   execute the source code:

    ```console
      OG-Core$ conda env create
    ```

10. The prior command will create a conda environment called `ogcore-dev`.
    Activate this environment as follows:

    ```console
      OG-Core$ conda activate ogcore-dev
    ```

11. To make sure that the `ogcore` Python package from the `OG-Core` repository is installed and operational in your `ogcore-dev` conda environment, type the following command at your command prompt.

    ```console
    OG-Core$ pip install -e .
    ```

If you have made it this far, you've successfully made a remote copy (a
fork) of the central `OG-Core` repo. That remote repo is hosted on GitHub.com at [https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core). You have also created a local repo (a [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#clone)) that lives
on your machine and only you can see; you will make your changes to
the OG-Core model by editing the files in the `OG-Core`
directory on your machine and then submitting those changes to your
local repo. As a new contributor, you will push your changes from your
local repo to your remote repo when you're ready to share that work
with the team.

Don't be alarmed if the above paragraph is confusing. The following
section introduces some standard Git practices and guides you through
the contribution process.

## Workflow

(Sec_GitHubIssue)=
### Submitting a GitHub Issue

GitHub "issues" are an excellent way to ask questions, include code examples, and tag specific GitHub users.

(Sec_GitHubPR)=
### Submitting a GitHub Pull Request

The following text describes a typical workflow for changing
`OG-Core`.  Different workflows may be necessary in some
situations, in which case other contributors are here to help.

1. Before you edit the `OG-Core` source code on your machine,
   make sure you have the latest version of the central OG-Core
   repository by executing the following **four** Git commands:

   a. Tell Git to switch to the master branch in your local repo.
      Navigate to your local `OG-Core` directory and enter the
      following text at the command line:

    ```console
        OG-Core$ git checkout master
    ```

   b. Download all of the content from the central `OG-Core` repo:

    ```console
        OG-Core$ git fetch upstream
    ```

   c. Update your local master branch to contain the latest content of
      the central master branch using [merge](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge). This step ensures that
      you are working with the latest version of `OG-Core`:

    ```console
        OG-Core$ git merge upstream/master
    ```

   d. Push the updated master branch in your local repo to your GitHub repo:

    ```console
        OG-Core$ git push origin master
    ```

2. Create a new [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#branch) on your local machine. Think of your
   branches as a way to organize your projects. If you want to work on
   this documentation, for example, create a separate branch for that
   work. If you want to change an element of the `OG-Core` model, create
   a different branch for that project:

    ```console
     OG-Core$ git checkout -b [new-branch-name]
    ```

3. As you make changes, frequently check that your changes do not
   introduce bugs or degrade the accuracy of the `OG-Core`. To do
   this, run the following command from the command line from inside
   the `OG-Core/ogcore` directory:

    ```console
     OG-Core/ogcore$  pytest
    ```

   Note that running this full suite of tests may take more than 6 hours (depending on your hardware). To run the subset of tests that run on each pull request (and take about 40 minutes), use  `pytest -m "not local"`.  If the tests do not pass, try to fix the issue by using the information provided by the error message. If this isn't possible or doesn't work, the core maintainers are here to help via a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core/issues).

4. Now you're ready to [commit](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#commit) your changes to your local repo using the code below. The first line of code tells `Git` to track a file. Use the `git status` command to find all the files you have edited, and `git add` command to add each of the files that you would like `Git` to track. As a rule, do not add large files. If you'd like to add a file that is larger than 25 MB, please contact the other contributors and ask how to proceed. The second line of code commits your changes to your local repo and allows you to create a commit message. This should be a short description of your changes.

   *Tip*: Committing often is a good idea as `Git` keeps a record of your changes. This means that you can always revert to a previous version of your work if you need to. Do this to commit:

    ```console
     OG-Core$ git add [filename]
     OG-Core$ git commit -m "[description-of-your-commit]"
    ```

5. Periodically, make sure that the branch you created in step 2 is in sync with the changes other contributors are making to the central master branch by fetching upstream and merging upstream/master into your branch:

    ```console
      OG-Core$ git fetch upstream
      OG-Core$ git merge upstream/master
    ```

   You may need to resolve conflicts that arise when another contributor changed the same section of code that you are changing. Feel free to ask other contributors for guidance if this happens to you. If you do need to fix a merge conflict, re-run the test suite afterwards (step 4.)

6. When you are ready for other team members to review your code, make your final commit and push your local branch to your remote repo:

    ```console
     OG-Core$ git push origin [new-branch-name]
    ```

7. From the GitHub.com user interface, [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/#creating-the-pull-request).

8. When you open a GitHub pull request, a code coverage report will be automatically generated. If your branch adds new code that is not tested, the code coverage percent will decline and the number of untested statements ("misses" in the report) will increase. If this happens, you need to add to your branch one or more tests of your newly added code. Add tests so that the number of untested statements is the same as it is on the master branch.


(Sec_SimpleUsage)=
## Simple Usage

`OG-Core` comes with an example run script [`OG-Core/run_examples/run_ogcore_example.py`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core/blob/master/run_examples/run_ogcore_example.py). Running this script will solve for the current-law baseline steady state and transition path solution of a calibrated version of an economy as well as a simple reform (increasing the corporate income tax rate) version of the model with its corresponding steady-state and transition path solution. This example script saves the full set of model output from both baseline and reform runs of the model. It also creates a large number of commonly used analytical figures and tables. This example run script is a nice foundation for using the model to run your own customized simulations. Below are the steps to running the example script.

1. Navigate to your local `OG-Core` repository in the terminal of your local machine and activate the `ogcore-dev` conda environment. If you have not created the `ogcore-dev` conda environment, follow steps 1-11 in Section {ref}`Sec_SetupGit` above.

    ```console
    OG-Core$ conda activate ogcore-dev
    ```

2. Run the Python example script [`OG-Core/run_examples/run_ogcore_example.py`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core/blob/master/run_examples/run_ogcore_example.py) by entering the following command in your terminal in your local machine `OG-Core` repository with the `ogcore-dev` conda environment activated.

    ```console
    (ogcore-dev) OG-Core$ python ./run_examples/run_ogcore_example.py
    ```

This might take more than an hour to run despite being optimized to use up to seven cores on your machine for parallel processing. The full set of model input objects for the baseline simulation of the model are stored in a newly created Python pickle file at the following path `./OG-Core/run_examples/OUTPUT_BASELINE/model_params.pkl`. The baseline steady-state model output is stored in a newly created Python pickle file at the following path `/OG-Core/run_examples/OUTPUT_BASELINE/SS/SS_vars.pkl`. The baseline transition path model output is stored in a newly created Python pickle file at the following path `/OG-Core/run_examples/OUTPUT_BASELINE/TPI/TPI_vars.pkl`.

The full set of model input objects for the reform simulation of the model are stored in a newly created Python pickle file at the following path `./OG-Core/run_examples/OUTPUT_REFORM/model_params.pkl`. The reform steady-state model output is stored in a newly created Python pickle file at the following path `/OG-Core/run_examples/OUTPUT_REFORM/SS/SS_vars.pkl`. The reform transition path model output is stored in a newly created Python pickle file at the following path `/OG-Core/run_examples/OUTPUT_REFORM/TPI/TPI_vars.pkl`.

A large set of plots that compare the changes among key variables from the baseline simulation to the reform simulation are saved in the `/OG-Core/run_examples/run_example_plots` directory. And a `.csv`-file table of key macroeconomic variable changes over the budget window (10 years) and in the long-run steady state is saved at the following path `/OG-Core/run_examples/ogcore_example_output.csv`.

## Footnotes

[^recent_python]:The most recent version of Python from Anaconda is Python 3.9. `OG-Core` is currently tested to run on Python 3.9 through 3.10.

[^commandline_note]:The dollar sign is the end of the command prompt on a Mac. If you are using the Windows operating system, this is usually the right angle bracket (>). No matter the symbol, you don't need to type it (or anything to its left, which shows the current working directory) at the command line before you enter a command; the prompt symbol and preceding characters should already be there.
