# Calibration of Macroeconomic Parameters

## Behavioral Assumptions

### Elasticity of labor supply

As we discuss in Chapter {ref}`Chap_House`, we use the elliptical disutility of labor function developed by {cite}`EvansPhillips:2017`.  We then fit the parameters of the elliptical utility function to match the marginal disutility from a constant Frisch elasticity function.  `OG-USA` users enter the constant Frisch elasticity as a parameter.  {cite}`Peterman:2016` finds a range of Frisch elasticities estimated from microeconomic and macroeconomic data.  These range from 0 to 4.  Peterman makes the case that in lifecycle models with out an extensive margin for employment, such as `OG-USA`, the  Frisch elasticity should be higher.  We take a default value of 0.4 from {cite}`Altonji:1986`.

### Intertemporal elasticity of substitution

The default value for the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, $\sigma$, is taken from {cite}`ABMW:1999`.  We set $\sigma=1.5$.

### Rate of time preference

We take our default value for the rate of time preference parameter, $\beta$ from {cite}`Carroll:2009`.  We set $\beta=0.96$.
